### Project Overview: 
The objective of this project will be the creation of a robot empowered by an Arduino microcontroller and a curated ensemble of sensors. Our team, "Tickle Me Pink," aims to proficiently clear lightweight wooden cubes that simulate snow. This task is intensified by the presence of varied obstacles, both static and dynamic. Harnessing the power of the Arduino platform, our robot will integrate custom-selected sensors to detect boundaries marked by the black lines, distinguish obstacles, and guide its snow-clearance operations. Factoring in the project specifications, the robot will also have scope for strategic expansions, particularly to accommodate a tailored plow. Initiating its task from a pre-defined corner, the robot will operate within set speed limits and aim to achieve its mission within 5 minutes.
